[COMMENT->]# when called, currently nothing is exported due to the reported bug i'm trying to fix.[LINE_BREAK->]
[COMMENT->]# however if I were to keep track of all WAIT/END blocks (to then call the equivalent setDoSaves on them)[LINE_BREAK->]
[COMMENT->]# we would then have to re-run all code below the END (i.e. we need to copy yesno again, and the RUN below it)[LINE_BREAK->]
[COMMENT->]#[LINE_BREAK->]
[COMMENT->]# Previous to WAIT/END it was impossible to have a target that could execute differently based on if it was called via a FROM or BUILD[LINE_BREAK->]
[COMMENT->]# but now our targets can depend on how they were invoked.[LINE_BREAK->]
