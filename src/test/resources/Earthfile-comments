# when called, currently nothing is exported due to the reported bug i'm trying to fix.
# however if I were to keep track of all WAIT/END blocks (to then call the equivalent setDoSaves on them)
# we would then have to re-run all code below the END (i.e. we need to copy yesno again, and the RUN below it)
#
# Previous to WAIT/END it was impossible to have a target that could execute differently based on if it was called via a FROM or BUILD
# but now our targets can depend on how they were invoked.
both:
    WAIT
        BUILD +indirect
    END
    WAIT
        BUILD +direct
    END
